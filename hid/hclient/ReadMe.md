HClient sample application
==========================

The *HClient* sample demonstrates how to write a user-mode client application that communicates with HID devices. (These are devices that conform to the HID device class specification.)

You will find this sample useful if you need to develop an application that communicates with, or extracts information from, a HID device. This sample illustrates a method for detecting a connected HID, opening that device for communication, and extracting or formatting the data into, or from, device reports.

**Note**  

To build this sample, you can use Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (Express, Professional, or Ultimate) and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1 Update. You can get Visual Studio 2013 and WDK 8.1 Update [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LInkID=239721).

You can also build this sample with Visual Studio 2013 (Professional or Ultimate) and [Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LInkID=391348).

For Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8 samples, download the [WDK 8 samples pack](%20http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317090). The samples in the WDK 8 samples pack will build only with Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012 (Professional or Ultimate) and WDK 8.
